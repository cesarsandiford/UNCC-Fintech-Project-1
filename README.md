<H1> ETF ANALYZER </H1>
<li>The python code is an ETF Analyzation tool which pulls data from API Keys utilizing the Monteâ€™Carlo Simulation but not limited to Monte Carlo initial Simulation data.  Its utilizing drawndown and sharpe ratio using imperical functions to calculate volatility.</li>

<H2><em><strong>STEPS TO OPERATING ETF ANALYZER</strong></em></H2>

<li>How would assets behave during an economic disruption?</li>
<li>What would be the volatility?</li>

<H1> Flow </H1>
<li>User uploads an API KEY to access asset class data for analysis.</li>
 <li>User selects a group of ETFs and Stocks for analysis. </li>
 <li> User imports and uploads .env file </li>
 <li> User pulls API to utilize data. (NOTE) this could be to import tickers.
 <li>This code seeks to pull and evaluate any particular asset class chosen to see what effects the current global financial environments   will have on the selected market. </li>

<H2>PULL TIMEFRAME </H2>
     <li>Pull time frame in order to determine a selected date in order to pull relevant data</li>
    <li> What is the purpose of pulling the specific timeframe
     <li>Are we meaning to include specific outliers, eg. COVID-19, or would you prefer to keep a more average flow of time? 
      
<H2>Pull Daily Return</H2> 
        <li>Daily Returns is the data which is pulled utilizing the API Key. </li>
<H2>PULL PLOT </H2>
     <li>utilizing hvplot </li>
     <li>Note:You may use a specific plot which utilizes tickers </li>
   
<H2>Utilize Empyrical Function</H2>   
<li>Empyrical Sharpe Ratio Function gives you risk adjusted returns</li>

<H2>Utilize hvplot</H2>
<li>hvplot is utilized as a means to show data in a more interactive way. It allows us to physically interact with the data in order for the user analyze the data more efficiently.</li>

<H2>Used dotenv</H2>  
<li>To load the dotenv file so we can use our secrete keys for the APIs</li>

<H2>import alpaca_trade_api as trade api</H2>
<li>The purpose of the trade api is to load the ticker information and put them into a dataframe</li>

  <H3><em><strong>Questions:</strong></em></H3>
<ol>

  <li>What were some of the challenges that were faced? How were they resolved? </li>
  <li>We are looking for the possible outcomes of data? </li>
   <li>What were the pre-pandemic vs post pandemic stock figures 2019 - 2021? </li>
         <li>How did the selected stocks perform, specifically during the pandemic? </li> 
      <li> Which Sector/Market had the lowest/Highest risk?</li>
</ol>
