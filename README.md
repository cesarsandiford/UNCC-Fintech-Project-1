<H2><em><strong>STEPS TO OPERATING ETF ANALYZER</strong></em></H2>
<li>This code seeks to pull and evaluate any particular asset class chosen to see what effects the current env would have BASED upon any specific period in time.  We are able to similate historical - present data to determine data based on specific conditions </li>

<li>How would assets behave and max draw-down each asset can give?</li>
